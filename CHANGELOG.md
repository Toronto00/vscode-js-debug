# Changelog

This changelog records changes to stable releases since 1.50.2. "TBA" changes here may be available in the [nightly release](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug/#nightly-extension) before they're in stable. Note that the minor version (`v1.X.0`) corresponds to the VS Code version js-debug is shipped in, but the patch version (`v1.50.X`) is not meaningful.
